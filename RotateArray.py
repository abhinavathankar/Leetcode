"""
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Follow up:

Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?


Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
"""
def rotate_array(nums,k):
    nums[:]=nums[len(nums)-k:]+nums[0:len(nums)-k]

    return nums

nums=[22,33,44,55,66]
k=3
nums=rotate_array(nums,k)
print(nums)
